# crash.py
Crash is a race car single player game written in python. A player requires to have python installed in his/her computer to enable the game to play. The game is compatible with any operating system.

crash.py starts without a prompt, I intend to add this feature in due time. The race car driver dodges blocks of concrete to avoid a crash. The blocks increase in speed, simulating the driver's acceleration.
The player controls the movement of the car with the left and right arrow keys.

The challenging part of making the game was determining a crash when it occured especially when the edge of the car was struck. if the x axis of the car was greater than the x axis of the block in its path then a crash would happen and the game ends.
